 <dd> 
...Dr. Ooi, charted his own Aeneid, beginning in faraway Penang, of arriving in America – and establishing himself here, against the contemporary currents of racial prejudice, as a surgeon. 

...Each of their stories highlighted a tangential yet meaningful contribution to America. History is churned through all the people that live through it with all of their distinctive experiences as imprints upon civilization.
