My 11th grade history project on the Votive Stele at the Gardner Museum was an exercise in connecting the classical Greco-Roman world, the South Asian world, and the Chinese world. After submitting the paper, I have continued working on expanding the sections on Gilded Age America,  Orientalism, the Gardner Museum, and contemporary art-collecting/transporting practice, while also reworking my argument on Buddhist iconography.
